Project 9 of the TeamTreehouse Full Stack JavaScript Tech Degree.

Use the popular Express web application framework and a SQL database to create a REST API that lets users create, list, update, and delete items from a school database. 

## Getting Started

To get up and running with this project, run the following commands from the root of the folder that contains this README file.

First, install the project's dependencies using `npm`.

```
npm install

```

Second, ensure that you have MongoDB installed globally on your system.

* Open a `Command Prompt` (on Windows) or `Terminal` (on Mac OS X) instance and run the command `mongod` (or `sudo mongod`) to start the MongoDB daemon.
* If that command failed then you’ll need to install MongoDB.

Third, seed your MongoDB database with data.

```
npm run seed
```

And lastly, start the application.

```
npm start
```

To test the Express server, browse to the URL [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).
